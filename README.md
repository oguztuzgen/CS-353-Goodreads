## Project Description


## Prompt

Social Cataloging Platform for Books (i. e. Goodreads) In this project, you are going to implement a system that lets users track books they have read. Users should be able to search for books by author, genre, year etc., mark their progress on books, rate and comment on books, create book lists, add friends and like/comment on their posts and recommend books to their friends Authors publish their new books on the system, may read and reply reviews about their books. A book may be a part of a book series (e.g. LOTR). A book may have various editions with different publishers, page counts, formats and languages (translator if necessary) etc. Librarians create reading challenges which users can join, edit erroneous information about books upon request by users or authors.
